<h1>Latin Food Review</h1>
<p>My friends and I were walking home from school, when we realized that the local restaurants lacked customers and needed a boost.
  So, we decided to make a food review website to help promote these local businesses and potentially bring in more customers. 
</p>
<a href="https://latinfoodreview.org/" target="_blank"><img src="Latin food review.png" alt="Latin Food Review" class="img-fluid"></a>

<p>
  The website features reviews of various Latin American restaurants in the area, along with photos and comments about the food. 
  We also included a map to help users find the restaurants easily. 
  I was tested on my web development skills, as I had to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript although we did use WordPress as a base. 
  I was also tested on my teamwork skills, as we had to coordinate and collaborate effectively to get the website up and running. 
  Finally I was tested on my SEO skills, as we had to optimize the website for search engines to ensure that it would be easily discoverable by potential customers. 
  We also had to reach out to the restaurant owners to get their permission to feature their businesses on the site.
</p>
  Overall, it was a fun and rewarding project that allowed us to support our community while also honing our web development skills.
