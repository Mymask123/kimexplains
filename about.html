<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!!! Welcome to my site, my name is Jooyoon.I was born in Seoul, South Korea, 2008, moved to America in the year 2016.
  I love learning new things(which is why I learned HTML,CSS, JavaScript to make this website). My ultimate dream is to become an Formula 1 engineer.
</p>
<p>Below, I'm going to be answering some questions that would help you know more about me!</p>
<h4>What inspired you?</h4>
<p>As a son of an engineer, I've always been familiar with the term engineering. 
  However, it wasn't until covid I found interest in enegineering. During covid, 
  my worked from home, and I got a glimpse of what my dad was doing. Moving 3D 
  models around and fixing the models gave me the initial spark of interest. Then, 
  as I was laying in bed scrolling through netflix and foudn this show: "Drive to Survive"
  It's a documentary about Formula 1 racing, but it focused more on the story of the drivers and engineers than the race itself.
  That right there, that's what caused me interest in engineering to explode.
